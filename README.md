# Little Lemon Newsletter Subscription App

## Project Overview
The Little Lemon Newsletter Subscription App is a React Native application that allows users to subscribe to a newsletter by entering their email addresses. The app features an intuitive interface with a logo, a title, an input field for email entry, and a subscription button that confirms their subscription via an alert.

## Installation
To get started with the Little Lemon Newsletter Subscription App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd little-lemon-newsletter-app
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can run the application on your preferred simulator or device. Use the following command:

```bash

```

You can then open the app in your emulator or physical device to see the subscription screen.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed for ease of use with a simple and clean layout.
- **Email Subscription**: Users can enter their email addresses to subscribe to a newsletter.
- **Feedback Alert**: Upon submission of their email, users receive a confirmation alert.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled and structured to be responsive across different screen sizes.

## Dependencies
The application uses the following dependencies (as defined in package.json):

- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `@react-navigation/native`: Enables navigation within the app.

Make sure these dependencies are included in your `package.json` to ensure the app functions correctly.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^6.0.6"
  }
}
```

## Project Structure
The project's structure is organized as follows:

```
/little-lemon-newsletter-app
|-- App.js               # Main application file that initializes the app and navigation.
|-- navigators/          # Directory containing navigation-related components.
|   |-- RootNavigator.js  # Set up the root navigator for application screen routing.
|-- SubscribeScreen.js    # Component for the newsletter subscription feature.
|-- package.json          # Project configuration and dependencies.
```

With this structure, the code is modular and maintainable, allowing for easy updates and additions in the future.
